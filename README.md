# robindrew-common
Welcome to my little common library. It is nothing special, often providing an interface to or duplication
of existing functionality, but I do try to avoid this!

This library is currently a base for all my projects, notably my trading and turnengine projects.

I always use UTF-8 encoding, so in Eclipse you need to:

    > Window > Preferences > General > Workspace > Text file encoding > Other: "UTF-8"

I also switch off restricted API errors

    > Window > Preferences > Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings > Decprecated and restricted API > Forbidden reference (access rules): "Warning"

Enjoy
