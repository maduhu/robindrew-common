Welcome to my little common library. It is nothing special, often providing an interface to or duplication
of existing functionality, but I do try to avoid this!

As a not I always use UTF-8 encoding, so in Eclipse you need to:

> Window > Preferences > General > Workspace > Text file encoding > Other: "UTF-8"

I also switch off restricted API errors

> Window > Preferences > Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings > Decprecated and restricted API > Forbidden reference (access rules): "Warning"

Enjoy
